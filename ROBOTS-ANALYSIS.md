## Explanation

The Daily Pennsylvanian's robots.txt file allows all search engine crawlers to 
access the site with a crawl delay of 10 seconds, ensuring their servers aren't 
overwhelmed by rapid requests. However, it specifically blocks SemrushBot, an 
SEO tool crawler, from accessing any part of the website, likely to prevent 
competitive analysis or unwanted resource consumption.
